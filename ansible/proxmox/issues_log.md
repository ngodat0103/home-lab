## ‚≠ê Issue 1: PCIe NVMe Correctable Errors in Kernel Logs  

**Situation**:  
On the Proxmox host, kernel logs were flooded with correctable PCIe AER (Advanced Error Reporting) messages related to the NVMe device. Example log:  
```
pcieport 0000:80:02.0: AER: Correctable error message received from 0000:81:00.0
nvme 0000:81:00.0: PCIe Bus Error: severity=Correctable, type=Physical Layer
```
These errors indicated PCIe Active State Power Management (ASPM) issues and were causing noisy logs, though not immediate data loss.  

**Task**:  
Stabilize the NVMe drive and eliminate PCIe bus error logs, while keeping the system reliable for 24/7 homelab operation.  

**Action**:  
- Disabled PCIe ASPM globally by editing GRUB:  
  ```bash
  sed -i 's/^GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=.*/GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet pcie_aspm=off"/' /etc/default/grub
  update-grub
  ```
- Rebooted the Proxmox host to apply kernel parameters.  

**Result**:  
- No more PCIe/NVMe error messages in `dmesg` or syslog.  
- System logs are clean and easier to monitor.  
- Stability improved at the cost of slightly higher idle power consumption (acceptable for homelab use).
