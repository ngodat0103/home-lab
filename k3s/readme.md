# Introduction
This repository contains a personal lab environment to **test and validate the migration process** from standalone Docker deployments to a lightweight Kubernetes cluster using [K3s](https://k3s.io/). 

> ⚠️ **Note**: This is a test environment used to evaluate concepts, configurations, and stability **before applying them to my real physical server**
