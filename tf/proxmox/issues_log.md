## ‚≠ê Issue 1: LXC in Private Network Can‚Äôt Reach External Internet

**Situation**:  
An LXC container running in a private Proxmox network (`192.168.99.0/24`) was isolated and couldn‚Äôt access the external internet.

**Task**:  
Make sure the container can reach external resources (apt, docker registry, etc.) while keeping it in a private subnet.

**Action**:  

‚úÖ **Enable IP forwarding on Proxmox host**  
```bash
echo "net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1" > /etc/sysctl.d/99-ipforward.conf
sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-ipforward.conf
```

‚úÖ **Set up NAT (iptables version)**  
```bash
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.99.0/24 -o vmbr0 -j MASQUERADE

# (optional) persist with netfilter-persistent on Debian/Ubuntu
apt-get update && apt-get install -y netfilter-persistent iptables-persistent
netfilter-persistent save
```
> Use either iptables **or** nftables (not both).

‚úÖ **Set up NAT (nftables, preferred on Debian/modern distros)**  
```bash
# Enable nftables service
systemctl enable --now nftables

# Add NAT table & chain
nft add table ip nat
nft add chain ip nat postrouting { type nat hook postrouting priority 100 \; }

# Add masquerade rule
nft add rule ip nat postrouting ip saddr 192.168.99.0/24 oif "vmbr0" masquerade

# Persist rules
nft list ruleset > /etc/nftables.conf
```

**Result**:  
Containers in the private subnet now resolve DNS and access the internet seamlessly. üü¢

## ‚≠ê Issue 2: Vagrant Auto-Network Config Breaks Custom Bridge Setup

**Situation**:  
Vagrant auto-generates `/etc/network/interfaces` entries for `enp0s8`, conflicting with a custom Proxmox bridge (`vmbr2`).  
This prevents using `enp0s8` as a dedicated uplink for a manual bridge.

**Constraint ‚Äî Why we don‚Äôt touch `vmbr0`**:  
`vmbr0` is the **Proxmox management bridge** and, in this lab, it is also the path Vagrant relies on to keep `vagrant ssh` working.  
Vagrant‚Äôs generated config expects a DHCP‚Äëenabled management interface and a valid default route reachable via that bridge. If you repoint or modify `vmbr0`, the Proxmox guest can become unreachable from Vagrant, breaking `vagrant ssh` and provisioning.

**Task**:  
Prevent Vagrant from overwriting network config while still allowing SSH access and adding a new public uplink via a custom bridge.

**Action**:  

‚úÖ **Disable auto network config in Vagrantfile**  
```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  # Leave vmbr0 alone so `vagrant ssh` continues to work.
  # Stop Vagrant from touching enp0s8; we‚Äôll manage it ourselves.
  config.vm.network "public_network", bridge: "enp0s8", auto_config: false
end
```

‚úÖ **Manually configure Linux bridge `vmbr2` and attach to `enp0s8`**  
```bash
cat <<'EOF' >/etc/network/interfaces.d/bridge-vmbr2
auto enp0s8
iface enp0s8 inet manual

auto vmbr2
iface vmbr2 inet dhcp
    bridge_ports enp0s8
EOF

# apply without reboot (ifupdown2 recommended on Proxmox)
if command -v ifreload >/dev/null; then
  ifreload -a
else
  systemctl restart networking
fi
```

**Result**:  
Vagrant keeps SSH stable via `vmbr0`, and Proxmox gains a separate bridged uplink on `vmbr2` using `enp0s8`. üü¢

## ‚≠ê Issue 3: Terraform Hangs When Enabling Agent Mode Without Documentation Review

**Situation**:  
While experimenting with the Proxmox Terraform provider, enabling the `agent` option on a VM caused Terraform to hang indefinitely during `apply`.  

**Task**:  
Diagnose why Terraform wasn‚Äôt completing and restore a reliable provisioning pipeline.

**Action**:  
- Investigated logs and noticed Terraform waiting on QEMU Guest Agent responses.  
- Realized the VM template used had **no `qemu-guest-agent` installed**.  
- Disabled the `agent` flag until templates were rebuilt with the agent installed.  

**Result**:  
Terraform plans now complete reliably.  
Future remediation: bake `qemu-guest-agent` into golden templates so the `agent` flag can be safely enabled. üü¢

## ‚≠ê Issue 4: Missing Promiscuous Mode ‚Üí External Traffic Not Reaching Proxmox VMs

**Situation**:  
VMs inside Proxmox (running under VirtualBox as the hypervisor) couldn‚Äôt receive traffic from the external LAN. SSH into Proxmox and inspecting TAP interfaces showed they had **no assigned IP addresses**, suggesting packets weren‚Äôt being bridged correctly.  

**Task**:  
Identify why external packets weren‚Äôt reaching the nested Proxmox guests.  

**Action**:  
- Checked VirtualBox NIC settings.  
- Found that **Promiscuous Mode** was disabled on the VirtualBox host adapter.  
- Enabled **Promiscuous Mode ‚Üí ‚ÄúAllow All‚Äù** for the Proxmox VM‚Äôs NIC in VirtualBox.  

**Result**:  
Traffic now flows correctly from external networks into Proxmox guests. SSH and services inside Proxmox VMs are reachable as expected. üü¢  

---

‚ú® **Pattern across all issues**:  
1. Start with a broken state.  
2. Narrow down to a root cause (forwarding off, autogenerated configs, missing agent, blocked promiscuous mode).  
3. Apply targeted fix.  
4. Document solution clearly for future reproducibility.
